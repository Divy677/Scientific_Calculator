# Scientific Calculator

A simple and interactive scientific calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations as well as several scientific functions like sine, cosine, tangent, square root, logarithms, and constants such as **Ï€** and **e**.

---

## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
* **Scientific Functions**: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Square Root, Logarithms
* **Mathematical Constants**: Ï€ and e
* **Responsive and User-friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use with a visually appealing layout
* **Real-time Calculation**: Supports dynamic input and immediate result computation
* **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if an invalid operation is entered

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd scientific-calculator
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the calculator:

## How It Works

This project is built using the following technologies:

* **HTML**: Used to structure the layout of the calculator and the buttons.
* **CSS**: Applied to style the calculator and ensure it is visually appealing and responsive.
* **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for the calculator operations. It processes user input, evaluates expressions, and displays the result in real time.

### Functions Supported

* **Basic Operations**:

  * `+` (Addition)
  * `-` (Subtraction)
  * `*` (Multiplication)
  * `/` (Division)

* **Scientific Functions**:

  * `sin(x)` (Sine)
  * `cos(x)` (Cosine)
  * `tan(x)` (Tangent)
  * `sqrt(x)` (Square Root)
  * `log(x)` (Logarithm)

* **Mathematical Constants**:

  * `Ï€` (Pi)
  * `e` (Eulerâ€™s number)

### Example Usage

* **Basic Arithmetic**: Enter `5 + 3 =` to get `8`.
* **Scientific Calculation**: Enter `sin(30)` to get the sine of 30 degrees (in radians).
* **Error Handling**: If an invalid expression is entered (like `2++3`), an error message `Error` will be displayed.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* **Web Browser**: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
* **Code Editor**: To make changes to the code, a code editor like **VS Code** is recommended.
